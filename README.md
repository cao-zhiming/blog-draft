I store the half-written blog posts here. There are nothing really special. Just don't want half-written stuff got deployed, that would waste **subdomians, time, electricity, and let out more CO2**.

If you are reeeeeaaaaaally extreeeeemely booooooring, see the LICENSE of this repo and have some fun.
**Note, that is not a real open source license. Just for fun.**
